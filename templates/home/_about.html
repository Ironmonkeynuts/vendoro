            <p>Vendoro is a lightweight, modern marketplace web application that helps small retailers and indie makers sell products online without the overhead of a full-blown e-commerce suite. The project aims to make listing, managing, and analysing product performance simple for shop owners, while offering shoppers a clean, trustworthy browsing and checkout experience. At its core, Vendoro removes busywork—so sellers can focus on their products, not their tooling.</p>

            <p>Today, many small sellers bounce between spreadsheets, social media DMs, and heavyweight platforms that are either too limited or too complex. Vendoro bridges that gap with a focused feature set: shop and product management, image handling, inventory tracking, customer reviews with replies, and a seller dashboard that surfaces sales, revenue, and review trends over time. It’s opinionated where it matters (clear flows, sensible defaults) and flexible where it counts (multi-shop support, CSV exports, and range-based reporting).</p>

            <p>The primary audience is independent sellers and small shops—people who need professional tooling but don’t have a dedicated tech team. For them, Vendoro provides:</p>
            <ul class="mb-3">
              <li>An easy way to create a branded shop and add products quickly.</li>
              <li>Built-in reviews that foster trust and drive conversions.</li>
              <li>A dashboard with KPIs (orders, items sold, revenue, AOV, new reviews) and time-range reports to make data-driven decisions.</li>
              <li>CSV exports for accounting, fulfilment, or deeper analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Vendoro will be useful to sellers because it eliminates friction at every step: creating a shop, uploading images, tracking stock, responding to reviews, and understanding performance without leaving the app. By exposing clear KPIs and time-series trends, it turns raw transactions into insight—highlighting best-sellers, underperformers, and seasonal patterns. This clarity supports decisions like re-stocking, pricing adjustments, or targeted promotions.</p>
